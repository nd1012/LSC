# LSC browser extension

This browser extension allows you to use LSC with any website.

Folders:

- [Chrominum](chrome/) - Extension compatible with these browsers (f.e.):
	- Google Chrome
	- Microsoft Edge
	- Vivaldi
	- Brave
- [Safari](safari/) - Apple Safari extension

For Firefox I'm waiting for Mozilla to support the manifest version 3, first.

## Installation

Unless the extensions are available in the extension stores, you'll have to install them manually. To do this, it's required to download the extension folder to your local harddisc and enable the extension developer mode in your browser. Then you can install the extension from its folder (some browser call it "Unpacked extension").

## Usage

After you installed the extension, you'll see a rocket icon beside the browsers address bar. Navigate to any website and click the rocket icon to launch LSC. Optional you can adjust the settings, or simply click the "Close" button to close the popup.
