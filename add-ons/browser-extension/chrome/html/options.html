<h1>LSC - JavaScript <code>localStorage</code> Cache options</h1>
<form>
<details><summary><label for="prefetch"><input type="checkbox" id="prefetch" name="prefetch"> Pre-fetch linked contents of a handled website</label></summary>
Pre-fetching means LSC will try to find all linked contents and load their HTML from the server before you even clicked the link. This results in a very fast browsing experience, but may produce some overhead, if contents from links that you never visit is being loaded.</details>
<details><summary><label for="session"><input type="checkbox" id="session" name="session"> Use the <code>sessionStorage</code> instead of the <code>localStorage</code></label></summary>
Using the session storage for cached contents will avoid storing sensitive information from a website. The session storage cache will be deleted as soon as you close the window (or tab) - it's a kind of private mode for the LSC cache.</details>
